Compress the **raw conversation** marked for compaction into structured JSON (output ONLY JSON, no other text).
**Always write all field values in English.**
**Scope**: {scope}{cwd_line}{budget_line}**Fill each field from actual content: if a field has nothing relevant, omit it entirely (an omitted field counts as empty). Never write placeholders like "none", "N/A" or "nothing to report", and never fabricate or pad just to fill fields — fewer, real fields beat complete-looking ones.**
Fields:
1. summary: what happened in this span — events, progress, decisions and the flow of the conversation (a narrative, not a list).
2. task: goal / status / todo (open items) / next_steps / blockers.
3. decisions: key decisions made here; **always include why for each**.
4. lessons: errors (symptom / cause / fix) + patterns (reusable things that worked).
5. context: env (environment/config), commands (verbatim is fine), artifacts (file/symbol refs), constraints (rules that must be obeyed).
6. user: the user's traits/preferences/habits (incl. working preferences such as tools, code style, communication habits); empty array if none.
**Compress tool results heavily**: keep only conclusions/commands/errors/decisions of lasting value; do not paraphrase verbatim tool output (the raw text is stored with the node).

Please give the compression result (JSON; **never exceed the total length budget stated above**):
